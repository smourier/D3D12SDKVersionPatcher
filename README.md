# D3D12SDKVersionPatcher
A tool that can patch an .exe file exports (actually it will create exports as an exe usually doesn't have any) to set [DirectX 12 Agility SDK parameters](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/gettingstarted-dx12agility/#2-set-agility-sdk-parameters)

To use it just run it in command line for example like this:

â€‹    `D3D12SDKVersionPatcher "E:\MyPath\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\MyExe.exe" 611 ".\D3D12"`

And it will patch the MyExe.exe with `D3D12SDKVersion` set to `611` and `D3D12SDKPath` set to `.\D3D12`
